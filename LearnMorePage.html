                        <h3>What is <span>Artificial Intelligence?</span></h3>
                        <p>In the simplest terms, AI which stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines 
                            that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the 
                            information they collect. AI manifests in a number of forms such as chatbots, intelligent assistants
                            and robots.</p>
                            <p>AI is much more about the process and the capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis 
                                than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of high-functioning,
                                human-like robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s intended to 
                                significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions. That makes it a very valuable business 
                                asset.</p>

                        <h3>How has AI <span>boosted development</span> in Robotics?</h3>
                    <p>AI is driving the robotics market into various areas, including mobile robots on the factory floor, 
                    robots that can do a large number of tasks rather than being specialized on one, and robots that can 
                    stay in control of inventory levels as well as fetching orders for delivery. Such advanced functionality 
                    has raised the complexity of robotics. Hence the need for AI. </p>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence or AI gives robots a computer vision to navigate, sense and calculate their 
                    reaction accordingly. Robots learn to perform their tasks from humans through machine learning which again 
                    is a part of computer programming and AI.</p>
